        Our treasure hunts are information-based scavenger hunts, or puzzle hunts, in which teams use their collective brainpower to solve clues. Each team is presented with a group of puzzles, or clues, which teams must solve in order to find a piece of information.
	Each clue leads to a location within walking distance, where players must find and use a vital piece of information to answer a question. This information could be words from a historical plaque, a series of numbers or an address, a landmark, or any other unique item that many
	of us walking down the street might merely pass by, unless we were looking for it.
	Teams travel through the streets of the playing area racing to see who will be first to find all of the information. After solving all the clues teams will return their answer sheets to the designated endpoint.  The earliest entry with the most correct answers wins

      <h1>Treasure maps</h1>

      Each player will receive an identical set of clues and a map, and with their team will solve clues involving wordplay, trivia, puzzles, anagrams, math, and other fun challenges. Because there are a variety of challenges, and everyone thinks differently, the treasure hunt can be an excellent team building activity.
      Treasure Maps will be provided at the starting location of whole area where treasure is hided to trace the treasure. Use the maps smartly to trace the treasure because it is the biggest clue in finding the treasure.
      Return the map at the endpoint.
